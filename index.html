        <h2>About This Game</h2>
        <p>
          hololive ERROR: the Game is a first-person horror game based on the
          hololive ERROR series of 2D narrative films. Players unfamiliar with
          the story video series can enjoy the game, but those who have seen the
          movies will be rewarded with deeper insights and comprehension. We
          invite interested players to see the tale films and other hololives.
        </p>

        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
          The story takes place in the town of Aogami, which has an uneasy
          reputation in various circles due to the legends and happenings that
          surround it. The main character is an occult magazine journalist who
          is following a clue left by his late grandfather, also a journalist.
          His investigation leads him to Aogami, where he encounters ghostly
          events. He's in his hotel room one minute, going through his notes and
          drafting his piece, and the next he's strolling the corridors of a
          mysterious school building.

              During today's lunch break, I visited the broadcasting department.
              I never thought I would be appearing as a guest on Kana-san's
              broadcast... It is a secret that I was very nervous. But really, I
              only have good friends around me...

              In addition, it is not uncommon for Kanade to be called as a guest
              on the school broadcast. He is a true leader, but he also has a
              sensitive side, but he never shows that part.

              At that time, it seems that he was angry after the broadcast

              almost every day. However, I noticed that I was gradually getting
              rejected, and now I'm forcing everyone to play karaoke during

              While the people around him were puzzled, he said with
